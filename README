=== Compiling mwcollectd ===

mwcollect depends on the following libraries:

- libcurl3
- libpcre3

And specifically under Linux also:

- libcap1 (can be deactivated, see below)


Go into the mwcollect base directory and run `make` to compile (`gmake` on *BSD)
Run `DEBUG=y make` if you also want to have debug symbols, debug log messages
and asserts enabled.

If you don't want to go through the struggle getting a decent libcap1 for your
distrobution or aren't using the chuid feature anyway, you can specify NO_CAPS=y
at compile time, e.g. `NO_CAPS=y DEBUG=y make`.



=== Installing and Configuring mwcollectd ===

- Edit the files in ./conf/, they're all pretty well documented.
- Optionally copy the subdirectories around, e.g. ./bin/ to /usr/bin/
- GZip and copy the manpage in ./doc/ if you want to access it.
- Invoke mwcollectd by ./bin/mwcollectd $(OPTIONS)
  A good point to start may be:
  
  ./bin/mwcollectd --version
  ./bin/mwcollectd --console-log=all --conf=conf/mwcollect.conf
  
- Make sure to edit all files in the conf/ directory or you may end up with a
  configuration, you don't like.

- Watch your sensors collect, go to #mwcollect on FreeNode if you need
  additional help or just to say `Thank you, great tool!'
  
- Subscribe to the ML under http://lists.mwcollect.org/ and give the developers
  valuable Feedback about the software!
  
  
  
=== Integrating with Prelude ===

- Build the log-prelude Module by prepending MODULES="log-prelude":

  MODULES="log-prelude" DEBUG=y make
  
  (Note that the log-prelude depends on libprelude v0.9 or greater)

- Adjust conf/log-prelude.conf to your needs.

- Uncomment log-prelude in conf/mwcollect.conf
