		v4.0.0, 2009-05-01


mwcollectd is a versatile malware collection daemon for POSIX environments
licensed under the LGPL v3 (see LICENSE.LESSER file). The reason for choosing
the LGPL instead of the GPL is to allow for proprietary modules to be linked
into the daemon.

The SMB implementation found under src/embed-python/modules/smb/ is taken
from dionaea and licensed under the GPL License (see LICENSE file).

This program implements ideas by Markus Koetter (esp. from Nepenthes and
evtest) and Tillmann Werner (honeytrap). The main maintainer is Georg Wicherski
<gw@mwcollect.org>.
